       and Michaelis-Menten Elimination without Lag Time Model for single-dosed}

\description{
  Includes user-supplied functions for model definition, integration method for solving ordinary differential equations,
  three kinds of weighting schemes for selection, and fitting algorithms for a one-compartment, extravascular,
  single-dose, zero-ordered absorption, and Michaelis-Menten elimination without lag time model.
